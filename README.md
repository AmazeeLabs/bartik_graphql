# Bartik & GraphQL

Example theme used in the first Amazeenar on GraphQL and Twig.
Requires the [GraphQL Twig](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql_twig)
module to work.

The templates use a `relatedArticles` GraphQL field, provided by a views configuration
packaged in this repository: [views.view.related_articles.yml](views.view.related_articles.yml).
You will have to import this view to make it work.
